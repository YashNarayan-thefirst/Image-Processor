Image Processor

Project 3 of COP3504C (Advanced Programming Fundamentals) involves manipulating TGA file data to create new images
A TGA file contains a header with all important data for the image such as size, color depth, etc. and the pixel data. 
This project involves creating 10 (and one extra credit) new images using certain files that have already been provided. Students must create the following functions:
1. Add
2. Subtract
3. Multiply
4. Overlay
5. Screen

In order to verify whether the new images are appropriately changed, reference images are provided. However, the student must create appropriate tests. 
To confirm the accuracy of the test, I recommend using the diff -s command in git bash.
